Hi Reviews.com,

I heard your reviews content system was hiring a Frontend Developer in NYC through . I'm interested in using my technical skills for increasing transparency for consumer products, and I believe my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JS, Javascript, SASS, jQuery, and associated web technologies would be an excellent fit towards that purpose at Reviews.com.

​For examples, please check out​ my personal projects. My Debt Payment Calculator (at https://geoffreyyip.github.io/dancing-cactus/) integrates D3.js into React for snappy visualization. My MTA Dashboard (at https://safe-fjord-88611.herokuapp.com/) leverages a hand-rolled scraping script on a Node backend to compile information from up to 68 different webpages into a centralized location. Repo links and implementation details can be found in my resume.

In addition to my personal projects, I am an active participant in my local Javascript meetups and a volunteer mentor for NodeSchool events. As a self taught engineer, I strive to improve myself every day, because there is always something new to learn.

I would love to set up a quick chat over the phone. I'm usually available on weekdays between 11am - 5pm. If you are interested, please send over a few open times, and we can coordinate from there.

Thanks,
Geoffrey Yip
