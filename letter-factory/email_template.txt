Hi ${COMPANY_NAME},

I heard your ${COMPANY_TYPE} was hiring a Frontend Developer in ${LOCATION} through ${DISCOVERY_METHOD}. I'm interested in using my technical skills for ${COMPANY_PURPOSE}, and I believe my knowledge of ${RELEVANT_TECHNOLOGIES} would be an excellent fit towards that purpose at ${COMPANY_NAME}.

​For examples, please check out​ my personal projects below. The Debt Payment Calculator integrates D3.js into React for snappy visualization. The MTA Dashboard leverages a hand-rolled scraping script on a Node backend to compile information from up to 68 different webpages into a centralized location.

In addition to my personal projects, I am an active participant in my local Javascript meetups and a volunteer mentor for NodeSchool events. As a self taught engineer, I strive to improve myself every day, because there is always something new to learn.

I would love to set up a quick chat over the phone. I'm usually available on weekdays between 11am - 5pm. If you are interested, please send over a few open times, and we can coordinate from there.

Thanks,
Geoffrey Yip
